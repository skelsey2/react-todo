(Next step: 1. implement working decrement button (via Redux) - new action, changes in reducer, button, etc,
2. Reduxifying the TODO app )

Install Redux
    npm i react-redux
    npm i redux

Actions - plain javascript object that has at least a property, like events
    operations.js
Reducers - fn that get called upon each dispatch of a given action and return the updated complete state
    index.js
constants - words like enums of actions
    actionTypes.js
configureStore.js - redux wiring
modified app.js to set up a store
component
    counter.js

counter.js file
// onClick: () => dispatch(increment()) this is where you be invoking the operations.js file
"never seen 2 providers aka stores in production"

Higher Order Components vs @Connect using decorators
mapStateToProps - store state not component state
mapDispatchToProps
dispatch - the magic fn that provided by redux wiring by mapDispatchToProps that allows you to fire actions

Edit - added in Edited on click and save btn to todo item

Ternery below is too much to read, extract out to a method like in TodoItem
 {
                    this.state.inEditMode ?
                        <>
                            <input onChange={e => this.handleOnChange(e)} value={this.state.editModeTodoText}/>
                            <button onClick={e => this.handleSaveClick(e)}>Save</button>
                        </>
                    :
                        <span onClick={e => this.handleEditClick(e)}>
                            {this.props.todo.text}
                        </span>
}

AddTodoInput - need to clear text on btn click, propagate value up to AddTodoBar
Dump Components - AddTodoInput, AddTodoBtn they don't hold state
Smart Component - AddTodoBar, holds the state
Controlled vs Uncontrolled - form components, input (classic interview question)
https://goshakkk.name/controlled-vs-uncontrolled-inputs-react/

uuid generate - key set at wrapper level, <TodoItem todo={todo} key={todo.id}/>
sloppy coding to not have the key, can leverage a pipeline to code smell and fail build without
https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid
https://medium.com/@adhithiravi/why-do-i-need-keys-in-react-lists-dbb522188bbb

// return with true/false, if true keeps, false removes
const fiteredTodos = this.state.todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== todoID);

Summary - made TodoItem and added delete functionality onclick of X for each TodoItem; react docs are in github, the docs are super helpful

ctrl + alt + l = autoformat
 import AddTodoBtn, { nums } from "./AddTodoBtn";   non-default requires { }; cannot have more than 1 default

 return (
     <>
       <AddTodoInput/>
       <AddTodoBtn/>
     </>
 );
 export default AddTodoBtn
 export const nums = 1;
 import AddTodoBtn, { nums } from "./AddTodoBtn";   non-default requires { }; cannot have more than 1 default

<AddTodoBar/> the / invokes constructor of the class, not self closes
 Wrapper for both AddTodoInput & AddTodoBtn
 why React.Fragment
  have a root element, doesn't interact with the physical dom
  React.Fragment = <>, just shorthand
  removes the need for a div to be placed
 but why wrap it in an element, can't return 2 things

{ raw execution of js } null, false, undefine won't display anything to the screen
   arrays are automatically rendered

class vs  className = class is reserved word so they used className to not conflict
Injecting React Components like <AddTodoBtn /> are capital
    while React components that represent html elements are lowercase e.g. <input />


JSX - JavaScript XML, must be valid XML not HTML
JSX return ( here ), is the syntaxtic sugar, don't forget it is still JS

file.d.ts = definitively typed definitions file, allows type ahead and docs

.bind lexical context, the fn approach;
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this
partial application of fn
fn currying
fn are 1st class citizens - fn act like any other variable

Provider Pattern - maybe not a just react pattern but commonly used
    ATBar is the provider for ATinput and ATbtn aka the wrapper/data holder


this.setState is asynchronous, careful with click console.log with arrays...
